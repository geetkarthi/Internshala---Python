ROYCE:
Do the dead frighten you?
You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
What is it?

NED:
And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
Get the lads to saddle their horses.
He swore an oath, Cat.
Tell Bran he’s coming, too.
He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
King of the Andals and the First Men …
You understand why I did it?
But do you understand why I had to kill him?
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
A madman sees what he sees.
There are no mountain lions in these woods.
It’s a direwolf.
Tough old beast.
Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
I’m sorry, Bran.
You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
It’s your gods with all the rules.
Tell me.
Your Grace.
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
My queen.
Tell me about Jon Arryn.
We both did.
Aye.
CATELYN:
Do you have to?
Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
I wonder if the old gods agree.
I am so sorry, my love.
Gods, but they grow fast.
How many times have I told you No climbing!
I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
Your Grace.
My queen.

WAYMAR
ROYCE: How close did you get?

BRAN:
Jon said he was a deserter.
Our way is the old way?
Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
So he was lying?
Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
NO!
Please, father!
What about you?
I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
But he’s coming right now! Down our road!

SEPTA
MORDANE: Fine work, as always. Well done.
MORDANE: I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners.

SANSA:
Thank you.
Will you shut up?
Would you please shut up.

JAIME:
But who would he tell?
That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.

THEON:
Mountain lion?
It’s a freak.
Right. Give it here.
I take orders from your father, not you.
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.

WILL:
I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
Close as any man would.
Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
They were here.

GARED:
We should head back to the wall.
Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
See where they went.

ARYA:
Where’s the Imp?
Arya.
That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
Where’s the Imp?

ROBB:
Relax your bow arm.
Lad, go run back and get the rest.
There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
Put away your blade.
What is it?
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.

CERSEI:
What if Jon Arryn told someone?
My husband.
You should be the Hand of the king.
We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.

JON:
Go on. Father’s watching.
And your mother.
Don’t think too much, Bran.
Father will know if you do.
You did well.
What is it?
Now there are five.
You want to hold it?
I’m not a Stark. Get on.

CASSEL:
Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
The law is law, my lady.
They don’t belong down here.

ROBERT:
You’ve got fat.
Cat!
Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
Who have we here? You must be Robb.
Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.
Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
Ned.
One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
